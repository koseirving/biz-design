# Biz Design

AI-powered Business Framework Learning Platform

## Overview

Biz Design is an AI-driven educational platform that transforms traditional business framework learning through interactive, AI-guided experiences. Users learn by doing - not just consuming content, but creating real business outputs with AI assistance.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Cloud SQL
- **Cache**: Redis on Cloud Memorystore
- **AI**: Google Gemini API for intelligent interactions
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform with Cloud Run

## Services

### Frontend (Port 3000)
- Next.js application with modern React features
- Server-side rendering and API routes
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Backend (Port 8000)
- FastAPI REST API
- JWT authentication with HttpOnly cookies
- PostgreSQL database integration
- AI-powered business framework analysis

## Quick Start
